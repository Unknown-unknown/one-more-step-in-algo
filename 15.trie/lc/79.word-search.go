 * Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.
 * 
 * The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell,
 * where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The
 * same letter cell may not be used more than once.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * board =
 * [
 * ⁠ ['A','B','C','E'],
 * ⁠ ['S','F','C','S'],
 * ⁠ ['A','D','E','E']
 * ]
 * 
 * Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
 * Given word = "SEE", return true.
 * Given word = "ABCB", return false.
