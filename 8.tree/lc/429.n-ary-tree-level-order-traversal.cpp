 * Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.
 * (ie, from left to right, level by level).
 * 
 * For example, given a 3-ary tree:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * We should return its level order traversal:
 * 
 * 
 * [
 * ⁠    [1],
 * ⁠    [3,2,4],
 * ⁠    [5,6]
 * ]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
 * The total number of nodes is at most 5000.
