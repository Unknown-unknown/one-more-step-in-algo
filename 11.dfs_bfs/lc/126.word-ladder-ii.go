 * Testcase Example:  '"hit"\n"cog"\n["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]'
 *
 * Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find
 * all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such
 * that:
 * 
 * 
 * Only one letter can be changed at a time
 * Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is
 * not a transformed word.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
 * All words have the same length.
 * All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
 * You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
 * You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * beginWord = "hit",
 * endWord = "cog",
 * wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
 * 
 * Output:
 * [
 * ⁠ ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
 * ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
 * ]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * beginWord = "hit"
 * endWord = "cog"
 * wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 * 
 * Output: []
 * 
 * Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible
 * transformation.
